    "## **1. Superposition: Parallel Processing of Multiple States**\n",
    "### **What It Is**\n",
    "- A qubit in superposition exists in a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ simultaneously.\n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - **Task 1**: `qc.h(0)` puts Qubit 0 in |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2.  \n",
    "  - This means the qubit is **both 0 and 1 at the same time** until measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why It Enables Speedups**\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: A single qubit in superposition can process **two states at once** (|0⟩ and |1⟩).\n",
    "- **Exponential scaling**:  \n",
    "  - **1 qubit** = 2 states (|0⟩, |1⟩).  \n",
    "  - **2 qubits** = 4 states (|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩).  \n",
    "  - **n qubits** = 2ⁿ states processed simultaneously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Classical Systems Can’t Do This**\n",
    "- Classical bits are **either 0 or 1**, never both.\n",
    "- To simulate **n qubits**, a classical computer needs **2ⁿ bits**, an exponentially growing resource requirement.\n",

    "## **2. Entanglement: Correlated States Beyond Classical Limits**\n",
    "### **What It Is**\n",
    "- Entanglement means qubits share a **non-classical correlation**—measuring one instantly affects the other, even at a distance.\n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - **Task 1**: After `qc.cx(0,1)`, the state becomes (|01⟩ + |10⟩)/√2.  \n",
    "    - Measuring Qubit 0 as 0 forces Qubit 1 to be 1, and vice versa.  \n",
    "  - **Task 2**: The Bell state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2 ensures that measuring one qubit **determines the other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why It Enables Speedups**\n",
    "- **Non-local correlations**: Entangled qubits allow **faster information transfer** than classical systems (used in quantum teleportation).  \n",
    "- **Quantum parallelism**: Entanglement helps **combine superpositions** in ways that classical systems cannot.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Error detection**: In **Task 2**, introducing an error (X gate) breaks entanglement, proving that quantum systems can detect disturbances that classical systems cannot.\n",

    "| **Superposition** | Qubits can be in multiple states at once (|0⟩ + |1⟩). | Bits are strictly 0 or 1. |\n",
    "| **Entanglement** | Measuring one qubit affects another instantly (spooky action at a distance). | No instantaneous correlation, only classical communication (limited by light speed). |\n",
    "| **Parallelism** | 2ⁿ states processed simultaneously with n qubits. | Requires 2ⁿ bits to simulate n qubits. |\n",

    "- **Superposition** enables quantum parallelism (processing multiple states at once).  \n",
    "- **Entanglement** enables non-classical correlations (faster information processing).  \n",
